# ASSUMPTIONS — decisions taken instead of questions

Every entry: what was decided, why, and how to reverse it. This file is the
operator's review channel.

## Tenant #1 intake (source: synthetic — a real intake overwrites cleanly)

Intake §1 was blank, so per mandate §0 the first tenant is synthesised. Every
field below is `source: synthetic` and lives in `tenants/reformas-demo/tenant.yaml`.

```yaml
company_name: Reformas Iberia Demo S.L. # source: synthetic
legal_form: S.L. # source: synthetic
cif_nif: B00000000 # source: synthetic (invalid on purpose — placeholder pattern)
location: Madrid, Madrid # source: synthetic
headcount: 20 (6 office / 14 field) # source: synthetic
annual_revenue: ~2M€ # source: synthetic
customer_mix: 70% B2C / 25% B2B / 5% public # source: synthetic
typical_project: 8–40k€, 3–10 weeks # source: synthetic
subcontractors: yes, mostly autónomos # source: synthetic
current_tools: Excel + WhatsApp + gestor # source: synthetic
biggest_pain: quoted-vs-actual drift per partida (margin leaks in modificados) # source: synthetic
must_keep: their gestor and their numbering habits # source: synthetic
languages: es-ES # source: synthetic
```

## Platform & runtime

1. **Reuse the existing verified foundation** (Turborepo/TS/Next/Prisma) as the
   factory substrate instead of restarting. Reversal: packages are standalone;
   any piece can be swapped. (Principle 9: boring, one language.)
2. **P1 persistence is in-memory behind kernel ports.** No Docker daemon in the
   build sandbox; correctness is proven by tests. The Postgres adapter (via
   existing `packages/db`, RLS per ADR-0007) is a P2 task. Reversal: implement
   the same `EventStore`/`Repository` ports with Prisma; contract tests already
   exist and run against any adapter.
3. **Execution via `tsx` + Vitest with `moduleResolution: Bundler`** for factory
   packages (new `packages/typescript-config/node-library.json`). Production
   build output is a P3 packaging task. Reversal: add tsup/esbuild build step.
4. **Naive semver matcher** (`^MAJOR` and `*` only) in the resolver — avoids a
   dependency; packs pin `^1`. Reversal: swap in `semver` package behind the
   same function.
5. **“Days of runtime” is implemented as resumability, not one long process**:
   every unit commits green and `PROGRESS.md` is the checkpoint; any restart
   continues. (Also logged in OBJECTIONS.md.)
6. **Multi-platform delivery** = responsive web (exists) now; PWA for
   mobile/tablet and Tauri shells for Mac/Windows are P3+ packaging tasks —
   the capability core doesn't care. Logged in OBJECTIONS.md too.

## Domain & money

7. **Money = integer cents; quantities = integer millis (thousandths); rates =
   basis points.** Rounding half-up (away from zero for negatives) **per line**,
   consistent with common Spanish practice under RD 1619/2012; gestor-level
   rounding differences are a known risk (RISKS.md). Reversal: rounding policy
   is a single kernel function.
8. **Tax rate history encoded from 2012-09-01 onward** (current 21/10/4 era).
   Dates before the earliest effective period **throw** rather than guess.
   Reversal: append earlier periods to the pack's rule table (data, not code).
9. **Renovation reduced-rate rule** implements art. 91.Uno.2.10º for
   `renovation_repair` works. Structural **rehabilitación** (art. 20.Uno.22º.B)
   is NOT auto-decided in v1: it conservatively falls back to the general rate
   with an explanatory justification. LEGAL_REVIEW.md tracks it.
10. **Missing eligibility attributes ⇒ general (higher) rate**, never the
    reduced one — conservative and defensible by construction.
11. **Invoices are immutable once issued; corrections are rectificativas**
    (credit-note style) in their own series. This is generic good practice the
    capability enforces; es-ES also requires it, ahead of Verifactu.
12. **Hash chaining** (SHA-256 over canonical JSON, per-tenant sequence) is
    implemented now as the es-ES chain adapter; the exact Verifactu _registro_
    field layout + QR (Orden HAC/1177/2024) is gated `legally_verified: false`
    until certified (deadline moved to 2027 — see LEGAL_REVIEW.md).
13. **Demo dates are fixed (2026-07-16)** via an injected clock so
    `make demo` is deterministic (principle 7).
14. **Line-item vocabulary**: capability stays generic (`lines`, `sections`);
    _partida/medición_ terminology and structures live in the reformas pack;
    tax-eligibility attributes travel as namespaced opaque keys
    (`construction.*`) interpreted by the jurisdiction adapter (ADR-0011).
15. **Boundary-linter “deliberate violation” is a committed fixture** the
    linter's own tests must flag — not a red commit on the mainline (mandate
    also demands every commit green; this satisfies both readings).
16. **IRPF retention**: general professional 15% / new-professional 7% /
    módulos 1% supported, selected by supplier profile; construction autónomos
    on _estimación directa_ (empresarial) default to **no retention** — the
    common real-world case, frequently gotten wrong. LEGAL_REVIEW.md has the
    citations; the profile field is explicit tenant data, not a guess.

17. **Persistence seam (P2.1a)**: capabilities take injected async store ports
    (`Repository`, `AppendOnlyStore`, `CounterStore`, `KeyValueStore`) defined
    in the kernel; in-memory adapters ship with contract-test kits that any
    durable adapter must pass unchanged (ADR-0007). Chain-head state is behind
    `KeyValueStore` (in-memory default until the durable hook lands in P2.1b).

## Diorka onboarding (real intake, 2026-07-17)

18. **"ERP START INPUT" baseline** = tag `erp-start-input` pinned by SHA in
    `docs/ERP-START-INPUT.md` (git proxy hides tags; the committed SHA is the
    durable record). New companies start via `factory new-tenant` — the
    baseline is conceptually present in every commit (no code forks exist).
19. **Diorka modelled as an owner GROUP over tenants** (BRD ORG-01..04): one
    tenant per legal entity, group registry `tenants/_groups/diorka.yaml`
    (pure data). Only entity #1 (`diorka`) exists until the BRD §11.1
    workshop confirms legal names — adding entities is `new-tenant`, minutes.
20. **Identity placeholders** in `tenants/diorka/tenant.yaml` are marked
    `source: pending-validation` (the BRD itself defers legal names/CIFs to
    its §11 workshop). Real values are a config-only overwrite.
21. **Sourcing comparison engine** built as a GENERIC capability (kernel-only
    vocabulary: lines/groups/bidders) — the Diorka evidence workbook is the
    motivating instance, not a special case. Missing price ≠ zero; selection
    explicit; prices dated + sourced (BRD SUP-03/04, Appendix A.1).
22. **Chapter catalogue** seeded into the reformas pack as config DEFAULT
    data (BRD Appendix A.2, Spanish wording) — tenants override freely;
    Catalan label set queued as config addition (NFR-10).
23. **Quote options & versions** implemented in the quoting capability
    (QUO-07/12/13): optional totals separate, acceptance selects options,
    revisions are new linked versions; accepted versions stay frozen.
24. ~~**cane.gestortectic.com** identified as a TecTic hosted "Gestor"
    instance (Catalan vendor; anonymous access 403).~~ **CORRECTED
    2026-07-17:** `cane.gestortectic.com` is Canei Subirats' own **public
    marketing website** (WordPress + Avada theme), not a login-gated gestor
    tool — the earlier 403 was transient/anti-bot, not an auth wall. The five
    page webarchives the operator supplied are the source. `gestortectic.com`
    is merely the hosting/staging domain their web agency uses.
25. **Real client identity = Canei Subirats, S.L.** (Carrer de la Creu 74,
    08960 Sant Just Desvern, Barcelona; hola@caneisubirats.com; 659 87 67
    00). The `diorka` tenant is the internal project/group codename; Canei
    Subirats S.L. is company #1's confirmed legal/trade identity, so the
    `tenant.yaml` branding + billing-seller placeholders are filled with
    these **public, first-party** values. **CIF (tax ID) stays
    `pending-validation`** — not published on their site; confirm at the BRD
    §11.1 workshop. Most reversible: fill known public facts now, keep the
    one unknown gated. Corporate identity captured in
    `docs/clients/canei-subirats/BRAND.md`.
26. **Working language = English; handover = Spanish/Catalan.** Per operator
    instruction we build the UI in English now and switch label sets before
    handover. UI strings are a **data label layer** (en/es/ca), not code, so
    the switch is config. Fiscal locale stays `es-ES` (Spanish VAT + money
    formatting `1.234,56 €`) — display language and fiscal locale are
    independent. Their live site (CAT default, ESP toggle) confirms
    Catalan-first is the handover expectation (NFR-10).
27. **"Execute the plan fully" (2026-07-17)** interpreted as: build the
    demonstrable **end-to-end customer-journey slice** now — the 12-stage
    lifecycle (lead→…→close), per-project financial control
    (budget/committed/actual/revenue/margin/cash/forecast), the full
    dashboard suite (pipeline, projects, margins, suppliers, purchasing, AR,
    AP, cash forecast, performance, alerts/tasks), and auto-drafted emails.
    R1→R4 in full is months of work; this cycle lands the working, visual
    whole-journey control tower + the email-drafting module so the vision is
    usable and inspectable. Most reversible: a self-contained interactive
    dashboard mirroring the real kernel logic (as `site/frontend.html` does)
    - real capability code behind it, all gates green. Deeper persistence
      wiring continues in later cycles.
28. **Emails: auto-generated, one Send press, never really sent.** Lifecycle
    events auto-draft an email (subject+body from templates that are DATA,
    not kernel/capability literals); the user edits if needed and presses
    **Send**, which drives a **log-only fake adapter** (`email-out@1`). No
    real email is ever sent from dev (mandate §3); real SMTP/provider stays
    in `INTEGRATIONS_PENDING.md` until the tenant supplies credentials.
29. **Premium redesign + review-request stage + Outlook drafts (this cycle).**
    E2E-tested the whole lead→invoice flow (headless, all 13 stages, ledger
    balances, no JS errors) and found the missing final step: a **review
    request**. Added it as the 13th lifecycle stage (`lead → profit → review`)
    across `site/journey.html` and `site/dashboard.html`, closing the
    reputation loop. Applied a lighter-white, winning-website design language
    (larger display type, generous whitespace, layered soft shadows, gradient
    accents, brand-mark SVG everywhere) to journey, dashboard and landing.
    Emails now render **full corporate identity** (logo, gradient bar, CTA,
    PDF-attachment chip, CI footer). **Outlook link:** no Microsoft Graph
    credentials/MCP exist here, so the most reversible honest option is a
    downloadable **`.eml` with `X-Unsent: 1`** — Outlook opens it as an
    **editable draft** in the compose window — carrying a **dependency-free
    generated PDF** attachment. Real save-to-Drafts via Graph is logged in
    `INTEGRATIONS_PENDING.md` (`outlook-drafts@1`) pending tenant M365 creds.
30. **More brand colour, still premium (this cycle).** "Less white, more their
    colours." Chose the most reversible strong-brand move: deep brand-green
    gradient headers with a white brand mark, a soft sage-green canvas (not flat
    white), richer green/gold washes, and a bold green featured card — while
    keeping white cards for contrast so it reads premium, not heavy. Tokens only
    - header markup; trivially tunable.
31. **Operator enters all data; site-visit photos; per-step project folder.**
    The journey page became a real client-side workspace: a full intake for
    every customer-journey input (feeds ledger/PDF/email automation), site-visit
    camera capture (`<input capture=environment>`), and a project folder with one
    subfolder per lifecycle step. Since the published site is static (no server),
    the most reversible honest implementation is browser-side: IndexedDB holds
    the project + files (photos compressed via canvas), artifacts (quote/invoice
    PDFs, .eml emails, notes) auto-file per step, and a dependency-free
    store-method ZIP writer (with CRC32) exports the real nested folder. Works on
    the live link and on mobile. The production equivalent (server-side folders
    on the docs/blob-store port) is described in the operations guide.
32. **Operations & setup PDF.** Built a branded, print-ready HTML guide rendered
    to a real 14-page PDF via the environment's headless Chromium (`page.pdf`):
    visual infrastructure diagram (SVG), layered architecture, 13-step process,
    RACI matrix, and a very detailed non-technical go-live setup (accounts → env
    vars → deploy → config), plus runbook, backups/GDPR, roadmap, glossary.
    Recommended hosting (Vercel + managed Postgres) is a suggestion, not a
    commitment — the hosting decision stays R4.
33. **Mobile fixes, best-practice documents, folder UX, process audit (this cycle).**
    From operator screenshots: (a) mobile was overflowing — root cause was
    grid/flex inputs without `min-width:0`; fixed that + wrapped wide stage tables
    in horizontal scrollers + small-screen type/padding. (b) Generated invoice/quote
    PDFs were too sparse — rebuilt them as full documents (seller+CIF, buyer+NIF,
    number, issue/due or valid-until dates, line items, base/IVA/total, IBAN +
    payment terms, and legal notes: art.91 justification, Verifactu 2027, immutable
    - rectificativa/SHA-256, guarantee). Added the missing intake inputs (buyer
      NIF/CIF, quote number, payment-terms days); dates auto from the browser clock.
      Seller CIF/IBAN are honest placeholders (pending validation). (c) Project-folder
      finder + step buttons made leaner (file-count badge, open/closed icons, current
      folder highlighted, one primary Download button, quiet Edit/Start-over links,
      '+ Attach file → folder'). (d) Step-by-step input→output audit added to the
      operations guide roadmap; the deeper practical gaps (quantity×unit pricing,
      deposit/certificación invoicing, IRPF retention, per-step dates, supplier/PO
      numbers, change orders) are mostly surfacing existing capability fields in the
      UI — configuration, not new architecture. Logged as roadmap, not built this cycle.
34. **Pages-email fix + interactive journey (this cycle).** (a) The Pages
    workflow triggered on `claude/**` pushes, which the github-pages environment
    rejects by branch protection — every branch push failed and emailed a
    failure. Restricted the push trigger to `main` (feature branches use
    workflow_dispatch). (b) Made the phase rail clickable (navigate to any
    reached stage; forward replays, back reviews). (c) Added a real estimator on
    the Estimate stage (qty × unit-rate lines → range; "Use as the quote"
    reflows chapters + ledger) — the estimate→quote path. (d) Gave every stage
    best-practice input fields (lead source; visit date/area; quote validity;
    acceptance date/method/deposit; project dates/PM; supplier/PO/delivery; bill
    no/date/progress; invoice date/type/IRPF; payment date/method; close
    date/notes; review platform/date), persisted + saved as details.txt; the
    invoice honours invoice date, type (full/deposit/certificación) and an IRPF
    retention line, regenerating live. Deeper best-in-class features (catalogue
    line-pricing, scheduling calendar, change orders) exist as capabilities and
    remain UI-surfacing roadmap, logged in the operations guide.
35. **"Build further" batch (this cycle).** (a) Locked zoom on all site pages
    (viewport maximum-scale=1/user-scalable=no + touch-action:manipulation) for
    premium navigation; added the missing viewport meta to frontend/backend.
    (b) Expanded the price-book catalogue to 34 items/11 chapters and shipped a
    complete itemised sample project (~€9.1k) with prefilled stage details.
    (c) Enhanced the estimator (catalogue quick-add, units, contingency %).
    (d) Added a scheduling timeline (tasks + mini-Gantt) on the Project stage and
    change orders (variations) on Execution — baseline frozen, current contract =
    baseline + variations, invoice revenue includes approved variations, new
    ledger row. (e) Upgraded the landing to a world-class page (feature grid,
    how-it-works ribbon, closing CTA). All client-side in the journey demo;
    reviewed end-to-end (full run, rail nav, valid 30-file zip, no JS errors,
    mobile clean). Production equivalents of scheduling/change-orders exist as
    capabilities; the demo mirrors them for the shareable link.
36. **iOS app — premium native shell over the live web app (this cycle).**
    Mandate: "build the iOS app so web changes flow through to the app later,
    make it very premium, best-in-class navigation, ship via TestFlight, give us
    a one-PDF manual of what to do on our side; then review/improve/audit in a
    loop until world-class; don't ask questions."
    Decisions (most reversible option, logged not asked):
    (a) **Architecture = native SwiftUI shell hosting the live GitHub-Pages web
    app in enhanced WKWebViews.** This is the single design that satisfies "web
    changes flow to the app automatically" — content/workflow/pricing changes
    need no App Store update; only native-shell changes (icon, tabs, OS) require
    a new build. Alternative (a full native rewrite of every screen) was rejected:
    it would fork the UI and break the "one change, everywhere" property that is
    the whole point. Files under `ios/` (kept out of the pnpm workspace and out
    of the boundary-lint scan, which only reads packages/kernel|capabilities|packs
    .ts — so no CI impact).
    (b) **Premium layer, all native:** animated brand splash, custom floating tab
    bar (material + gold matched-geometry pill + haptics), translucent top bar
    with a live determinate progress line, native pull-to-refresh, graceful
    offline state, native share sheet, JS⇄native bridge (haptics/share), and a
    `native-app` class + injected CSS that collapses the site's own header inside
    the shell so there is no duplicated chrome. Zoom already locked site-side.
    (c) **File exports work natively:** WKDownloadDelegate captures the web app's
    ZIP/PDF/.eml exports and routes them to the share sheet (Save to Files,
    AirDrop). Camera/photo Info.plist permission strings included for site-visit
    capture. Persistent WKWebsiteDataStore so the IndexedDB project workspace
    survives launches.
    (d) **Robustness (audit rounds):** tab bar as a bottom safe-area inset (web
    content never hidden behind it); re-tap active tab = scroll-to-top (preserves
    form state); NWPathMonitor auto-recovers the offline screen when signal
    returns (field-site drops); auto-reload on web-content-process termination;
    VoiceOver labels. Colour scheme forced light to match the locked-light web.
    (e) **Bundle id** = honest placeholder `com.caneisubirats.erp`; DEVELOPMENT_TEAM
    left empty for the operator to set (documented). No secrets committed;
    `.gitignore` blocks `*.p8`/certs. No real Apple uploads performed here — the
    operator runs them (fakes-behind-ports discipline extends to "no real
    filings/uploads on our behalf").
    (f) **TestFlight setup:** ready-to-open Xcode 16 project (file-system-
    synchronized) + XcodeGen `project.yml`/`setup.sh` fallback; fastlane `beta`
    lane; a **manual-dispatch-only** GitHub Actions workflow (never fires on
    ordinary pushes → no failure emails). Delivered a 12-page premium
    **iOS Beta Onboarding PDF** (`site/Canei-Subirats-iOS-Beta-Onboarding.pdf`,
    linked from the landing page) covering every manual step for a non-technical
    operator: Developer Program, App Store Connect app record, three build paths,
    the API key, inviting testers, a test checklist, updates, FAQ, glossary.
    (g) Could not compile here (no Xcode/Swift toolchain on Linux); mitigated with
    rigorous static review + an independent adversarial Swift review pass, and the
    guaranteed-valid XcodeGen regeneration path. The in-app web appearance was
    verified by simulating the shell in headless Chromium (inject `native-app`
    class + CSS at iPhone size) — headers collapse cleanly, no horizontal overflow.
37. **iOS build green on TestFlight + full automation & testing (this cycle).**
    (a) The CI TestFlight pipeline went green: build #9 compiled, signed
    (automatic cloud signing via -allowProvisioningUpdates + ASC API key on the
    ARCHIVE only — export reuses the installed profile; passing auth to export
    caused xcodebuild error 64), exported the .ipa, and uploaded. Sequence of
    real fixes (all logged in git): base64 .p8 secret (invalid-curve-name),
    empty-CI-env→default guard (env_or), apple-generic versioning for the
    build-number bump, absolute /tmp key path, archive-only auth, and finally
    **Xcode 26 / iOS 26 SDK** on macos-latest (Apple 409 rejects the iOS 18.5
    SDK). Team ID 5V62K942X6 and ASC key id/issuer baked in as non-secret
    defaults; only ASC_KEY_P8 (base64) is a required secret. I drove the runs
    myself via workflow_dispatch and read the logs to converge.
    (b) **Autonomous web E2E** (`tests/site-e2e/run.mjs`, `pnpm test:site`):
    serves `site/` and drives the whole journey in headless Chromium —
    sample→Start→advance 13 stages, asserts ledger revenue (€9,149.00), rail
    navigation, a valid PK-zip export, no console errors, and no 390px overflow.
    13/13 green here; CI workflow `site-e2e.yml` runs it on main/PR. It caught a
    real bug — no favicon → `/favicon.ico` 404 — fixed by adding `site/favicon.svg`
    (brand mark) + `<link rel=icon>` on all pages.
    (c) **Autonomous native UI tests** via Maestro (`ios/maestro/*.yaml` +
    `ios-ui-tests.yml`): builds the app for the simulator (no signing), boots a
    sim, installs, runs launch/tab-nav/journey flows, uploads a JUnit report +
    screenshots. macOS-only (can't run in this Linux env) — authored + documented,
    manual-dispatch to avoid failure emails. Mirrors the article's two ideas
    (fastlane deployment automation = already built; Maestro autonomous testing).

38. **Development preview site at /preview + direct-to-main (this cycle).**
    Operator wants a separate live URL to co-develop with a collaborator on the
    dev branch, promoting to production after alignment; also asked that changes
    go straight to `main` from now on. (a) `pages.yml` now assembles ONE Pages
    deployment: `main`→ site root (production), the dev branch → `/preview/`
    (dev). Preview pages get a small fixed "Dev preview" pill. All site links are
    relative, so the subpath works. (b) The `github-pages` environment only lets
    `main` deploy, so a dev-branch push can't deploy directly; `preview-refresh.yml`
    fires on dev-branch pushes and dispatches `pages.yml` on `main`, which
    rebuilds `/preview/` from the dev branch by name — auto-refresh with **no
    repo-settings change**. (c) Per operator instruction I now commit directly to
    `main` (branch + main kept in sync); the collaborative flow is: iterate on the
    dev branch → watch `/preview/` → merge to `main` to publish. Reversible: revert
    the two workflow files to return to single-site publishing.

39. **Reusable, self-improving "App Producer" agent + Template repo (this cycle).**
    Packaged the whole web→native-iOS→TestFlight→testing pipeline as a Claude Code
    agent (`.claude/agents/app-producer.md`) so it's reusable in any project/chat,
    and into the shared `stefangruber001/Template` repo (installer copies agents
    into a new repo's `.claude/agents/`). Made it **self-improving**: it reads a
    git-backed `learnings/LEARNINGS.md` ledger in the Template repo on start and
    appends new `symptom→cause→fix` learnings on finish, so every project teaches
    it and every call arrives updated. **Reversibility/decisions:** (a) named the
    agent "App Producer" (per operator) and superseded the earlier
    `ios-web-shipper.md` rather than keeping both, to avoid a stale duplicate —
    git history preserves it. (b) Ledger lives in the Template repo (single shared
    memory across all projects), not per-project. (c) Hard guardrail baked into
    the agent + ledger header: **never** persist secrets, `.p8`/keys, tokens, PII
    or client-confidential data — only generalizable technical learnings. (d) The
    installer copies agent files only; learnings are pulled by the agent at
    runtime so a stale local copy can't shadow newer shared knowledge.

40. **Optional Work removed from the tenant product; generic capability kept
    (this cycle).** Operator asked to eliminate the "Optional Work (shown
    separately)" feature ("no need") and to update all related code + docs. A
    scoping question (how deep: also gut the `quoting` capability, or only the
    tenant-facing surfaces?) could not be delivered to the operator, so per the
    autonomy contract I chose the **most reversible** option and logged it.
    **Decision:** remove Optional Work from every tenant-facing surface — the
    presupuesto builder (optional checkbox + acceptance option selection), the
    quote page optional section/totals, the branded print PDF, the dashboard
    summary, `i18n` keys, the interactive `site/journey.html` + `site/frontend.html`
    demos, the reformas "Trabajos opcionales"/"Optional works" catalogue chapter
    (18→17 chapters), the diorka `SCREEN-PREM` catalogue item, and the docs —
    while **keeping** the generic `@repo/capability-quoting` optional-line model
    - service + tests untouched. Rationale: capabilities carry no tenant/sector
      opinion (whether options are surfaced is tenant/UI config), and rewriting
      ~half a generic platform capability's test suite to drop neutral vocabulary
      is the least-reversible, highest-blast-radius move for a factory meant to
      serve many tenants. The JSON quotes API DTO still mirrors the capability
      shape (`optionalCents`, always 0 now) as neutral plumbing. The raw BRD
      extract (`intake/diorka/brd-extracted.txt`) is left as the historical
      source of record; the descope is reflected in `REQUIREMENTS-MAP.md` and
      objected in OBJECTIONS #6. Fully reversible via git. **One deferred item:**
      `site/backend.html` is a point-in-time "real capture" of the backend API
      whose embedded fiscal JSON carries SHA-256 chain seals — it still shows an
      old optional line and `optionalCents: 48000`. Hand-editing it would produce
      invalid seals, so it must be RE-CAPTURED from a fresh live run (a new
      capture will naturally show `optionalCents: 0` and no optional line) rather
      than forged; left untouched until then.
